===========

*objectphone* was originally written by Micah Walter (@micahwalter) of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum (@cooperhewitt) as [an experiment with their Collection API](http://labs.cooperhewitt.org/2013/object-phone/). The code here is based on Micah's original code in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/micahwalter/5407518).
